We work on enhancing climate risk assessments and infrastructure resilience in built and environmental systems.<br/>
Dr. Najibi's research group focuses on understanding multisector, deeply uncertain, and dynamic climate risks to enhance resilience and adaptation to multi-hazards evolving with the changing environment.<br/>
Our interdisciplinary, mission-driven research tackles a broad spectrum of challenges, from evaluating the risks of extreme weather events to enhancing system resilience and developing robust planning and management strategies that can adapt to a changing environment and anthropogenic landscape transformations.<br/>
The ultimate goal is to develop better ways to address the pressing challenges posed by multisector evolving risks and to create more resilient communities and sustainable interconnected systems (built, natural, and human) that can withstand and adapt to the multifaceted impacts of a rapidly changing climate and environment.

What we do
======
Our focus is mainly on improving traditional perspectives centered on multi-scale hydroclimate systems analysis under three synergistic core areas:<br/>
1) Understanding the climate risks associated with natural and built environments exposed to hydroclimate extremes (e.g., floods, droughts, extreme precipitation events, heat/coldwaves)<br/>
2) Adapting stochastic decision models to enhance climate resilience in infrastructure systems and ecosystems in response to hydroclimate variability and climate change impacts<br/>
3) Integrating process-based insights with ensemble-based frameworks to assess the climate vulnerability of infrastructure systems and the public well-being.<br/>

Why we do
======
Many infrastructure systems are aging, with critical components nearing or exceeding their intended lifespans, making them particularly vulnerable to climate-related stresses. These systems together with ecosystems and other urban systems may lack the resilience needed to cope with the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.<br/>
Climate risk coordinators and planners must prepare for the increased stress of changing climate, but significant uncertainty remains about how the climate will evolve in the coming decades. While most climate projections agree that the future will be warmer with intensified extremes, the rate of these changes is less certain, as are more nuanced shifts such as changes in the average patterns of frequency, duration, and intensity or alterations in atmospheric circulation that could impact regional conditions.<br/>
In addition, infrastructure systems are highly vulnerable to natural climate variability unrelated to climate change, and this range of natural fluctuations must also be considered in future short-to-long term planning efforts, underscoring the urgent need for re-evaluating factsheets and adaptation strategies.
